SocialCite
==========

SocialCite is a ground up customized CMS based off of industry standards. Here's why you'll love it.
Beautiful & Functional
SocialCite utilizes industry standards including jQuery, Bootstrap and Glyphicons for responsive design and easy-to-brand customization.

It's easier than ever to make a website with other CMSs, but are the tools adequate for your needs?

SocialCite utilizes a MVC framework style approach and is built using its sister project, the PHP implimentation of Fram3w0rk, a project designed to unify cross-language differences. (Currently being developed in PHP and Python flavors.)

Desktop & mobile optimized





Simplicity
We give you the ability to mold your creation any way you would like. Sure, there are CMSs with millions of existing modules. But you don't just want any of them, and you don't want to create a module that must be built around the strict standards of the CMS. You want something that lets you build your own unique design, logic, and concepts.

With a minimalistic approach towards CMS, SocialCite is focused towards you, the developer.
